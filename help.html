		<h2>What is this server?</h2>
		<p id="Intro">The MAFS (Mothers Advocating For Study) fileserver was hypothetically supposed to host files for high school students, including subject notes, assessment notifications and miscellaneous data files, but no-one actually ponied up for hosting costs/knew how to rent a VPS and hosting a server on a home network's dynamic IP would have been a massive pain for everyone to use. This repository exists for archival purposes only.</p>
		<h2>Notes on directory hierarchy</h2>
		<p id="Explain">The folders for each subject should contain a PDF of the course outline and sub-folders for each module of the subject, which should in turn contain a Notes and an Exercises folder.</p>
